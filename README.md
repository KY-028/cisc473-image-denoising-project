## üöÄ Project Overview

This project aims to explore and develop **lightweight** neural network architectures for image denoising, especially suitable for deployment on resource-constrained devices (e.g. mobile, edge). We will benchmark existing lightweight models, propose one (or a variant) of our own, and evaluate the trade-offs between **denoising quality** (PSNR / SSIM) versus **efficiency** (parameters, FLOPs, inference time).

Our guiding questions:

- What architectural choices make a denoiser ‚Äúlightweight‚Äù without sacrificing too much quality?
- Can simple pruning, quantization, or architectural tweaks yield significant performance gains?
- How do different noise types (Gaussian, real-world, smartphone) affect results?
