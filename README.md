# Lightweight Image Denoising

**Project for CISC 473 - Deep Learning**

**Team Members:** Kevin Yao, Steven Li, Zhangzhengyang Song

## üöÄ Project Overview

This project aims to explore and develop **lightweight** neural network architectures for image denoising, especially suitable for deployment on resource-constrained devices (e.g. mobile, edge). We will benchmark existing lightweight models, propose one (or a variant) of our own, and evaluate the trade-offs between **denoising quality** (PSNR / SSIM) versus **efficiency** (parameters, inference time, memory usage).

Our guiding questions:

- What architectural choices make a denoiser ‚Äúlightweight‚Äù without sacrificing too much quality?
- Can simple pruning, quantization, or architectural tweaks yield significant performance gains?
- How do different noise types (Gaussian, real-world, smartphone) affect results?

## üõ† Setup & Usage

### Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch
- torchvision, numpy, PIL
- (Optional) CUDA for GPU training

Install via:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to Run the Training

Make sure you are in the project root folder (the same level as `src/`).

Then run the training script using module mode:

```bash
python -m src.train.train_dncnn
```

After training, run the visualization script to display results and compute PSNR/SSIM:

```bash
python -m src.visualize.visualize_denoising
```

You may also run the test script with a set seed to replicate results shown in the report.

```bash
python -m src.test.test_dncnn
```
